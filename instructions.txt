To set up flask:
    1. create virtual environment with:  python -m venv venv
    2. activate virtual environment with: 
        a. For windows computer:  venv/Scripts/activate
        b. For linux computer: source venv/bin/activate

    3. pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy

To run the flask app:   python app.py
To run the strategy_design file:   python strategy_design.py
To run the composite_design file:   python composite_design.py


How it in strategy_design works:

If I enter the amount and leave the acc_type, acc_type will be automatically determined
If I enter acc_type and leave the amount, the default amount will be automatically determined
If I leave both acc_type and amount blank, the defaults will be set to the "Basic" acc_type
